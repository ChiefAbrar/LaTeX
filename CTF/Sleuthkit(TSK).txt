The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a collection of command-line tools used for digital forensics to analyze disk images and recover files and data from various file systems. It supports file systems like FAT, NTFS, EXT, HFS+, UFS, and more.

Key TSK Tools and Usage:

1. mmls (Media Management List):
	Purpose: Lists the partition layout of a disk or disk image.
	Usage: mmls <disk-image>	Example: mmls disk.img
	Outputs start/end sectors, partition types, and sizes.
2. fls(File List):
	Purpose: Lists files and directories in a file system, including deleted files.
	Usage: fls [options] <image> [inode]	Example: fls -r disk.img	Options: -r: Recursively lists directories and files.
	Lists all files and directories, along with inode numbers.
3. icat (Inode Cat):
	Purpose: Extracts file content using its inode number.
	Usage: icat <image> -o <offset> <inode>		Example: icat disk.img -o 360448 2371	Options: -o: Offset of the partition (where the file system starts).
4. istat (Inode Stat):
	Purpose: Displays detailed information about a specific inode, including file metadata.
	Usage: istat <image> <inode>	Example: istat disk.img 2371
	Outputs file metadata for the inode 2371 (file size, permissions, timestamps, etc.).
5. fsstat (File System Stat):
	Purpose: Displays details about the file system (e.g., type, layout, metadata locations).
	Usage: fsstat <image>		Example: fsstat disk.img
	Displays information like block sizes, superblock info, and file system layout.
6. tsk_recover (File Recovery):
	Purpose: Recovers all files from a partition, including deleted files.
	Usage: tsk_recover <image> <output-directory>	Example: tsk_recover disk.img /output/recovered_files/
	Recovers files from disk.img to the specified directory.
7. blkls (Block List):
	Purpose: Extracts all unallocated (deleted) blocks from a file system.
	Usage: blkls <image>	Example: blkls disk.img
	Extracts unallocated blocks from the disk image.
